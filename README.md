# simple-DMRG-with-MPS
Basic and simple module to run the density matrix renormalization group algorithm (DMRG) for matrix product states (MPS).

The main file is the [DMRG_functionalities.ipynb](DMRG_functionalities.ipynb) that explains the algorithm and functions in ```DMRG.py```.

[executable_Ising.ipynb](DMRG_Ising.ipynb) creates the phase diagram of the 1D transverse field Ising model.

This is inspired from TeNPy (https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy)
